This project explores texture synthesis using a U-Net architecture combined with self-similarity maps, similar to the type of work I contributed to in my previous role


The file, tesselation.py has the implementation of the techniques presented in the paper: Transposer: Universal Texture Synthesis Using Feature Maps as
 Transposed Convolution Filter by GUILIN et al. arXiv:2007.07243v1  [cs.CV]  14 Jul 2020
